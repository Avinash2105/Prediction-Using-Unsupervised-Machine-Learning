GRIP-TSF-The Spark Foundation (Data Science and Business Analysis Internship)

Task #0: LinkedIn Profile Improvement:
          >LinkedIn Link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/avinash2105/
 
 Task #2: Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning:
          >In this task,we will be given iris dataset to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
          For this we will be using one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well known clustering problem which is K-Means clustering algorithm.
